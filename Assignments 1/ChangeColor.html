    <p>JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
        The programs in this language are called scripts. <br> 
        They can be written right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
        <br> Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don't need special preparation or compilation to run.</p>
