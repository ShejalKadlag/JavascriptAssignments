    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for the front-end development of web pages and web apps.
         It's a versatile scripting language that can be embedded into HTML code and executed by web browsers. JavaScript enables programmers
         to add website functionality, enhance user experience, and interact with web elements.JavaScript is a powerful programming language that is widely used in web development. 
    </p>

    <p>JavaScript also is compatible with other languages. This is super important as web servers run on different languages whether itâ€™s PHP, Python, Ruby, Java or .NET. Because the JavaScript running in the browser is 100% decoupled from how HTML web pages are generated, users will always have the same rich experience as JS works, no matter the server-side language used. It provides interactivity and dynamism to web pages, 
        making them more engaging and user-friendly. In this article, we will explore how JavaScript works, its role in web design and development, 
        and why it is such an important technology for creating modern web applications.</p>

        <p>JavaScript is what is known as a client-side script. Most Web applications, such as a search engine, work because of an interaction
             between the user's device (e.g. computer, phone or tablet) and a remote server. The software on the remote server sends information
              to the client (i.e. the user's machine) and the software on the client side reads the information and renders a Web page on screen.</p>
